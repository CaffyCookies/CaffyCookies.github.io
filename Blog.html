What makes video games so enticing and entertaining?
<br>
<br>		
Video games have many graphics and different sorts of stories that can entertain many different interest groups. With the many possibilities it allows people to consistently be surprised or experience new things which can give a sense of achievement. That sense of achievement can be accomplished as well by the game creating goals or milestones that often give a dopamine boost from completion.
<br>
<br>		
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/why-people-love-games.html 
<br>
<br>		
	According to the article video games have such interest due to the choices and actions we control in an environment that only simulates consequence rather than having actual risk. As well as having a sense of importance made from the fake consequence, video games abuse the system of competition which as seen through all of history is an extremely powerful driving force and motivator. The utility of competition is almost endless, as others develop their skills they will be matched with a challenge and the consistent challenge allows games to hold people's interest for extended periods of time.

Look up your favorite game for a review, do you agree or disagree, write a paragraph
<br>
<br>		
https://www.corrosionhour.com/valorant-review/
<br>
<br>
	I mostly agree with the article written by Digital Ghost especially on the mechanical aspects mentioned. The sound design is well done as the ability to use sound cues for positioning and covering other actions adds a need for situational awareness. The economy system is also an extremely important system that players need to be aware of as it can give advantage and disadvantage each round but ultimately you can still win regardless of economy with enough skill. Though the one point I do not fully agree with is the quality of the storyline as, yes it is seen throughout the map, and yes it is well developed but it is very separate from the actual game and is simply only an addition. Most people are unaware of the actual story and it is not advertised well as a part of the game rather something that some people happen to find.

Then find your dream rig online. It could be a prebuilt or it could be a custom made machine. It could be a desktop or a laptop. You decide what you want to prioritize. Explain why this would be a good computer for you.

	I already own almost my dream PC but I'd also settle for this PC as it has all the specs to run any games I'd want to play. With a terabyte of space as well as 32 gb of ram storage and running multiple things at the same time will not be a problem whatsoever. As well as high performance GPU and CPU I will be able to run whatever specific game I'd like such as heavier triple A games and if I'm able to run heavy games I'd also be able to do regular tasks such as schoolwork and streaming videos perfectly fine. On top of its general strength it has a good aesthetic appeal seeing as how the purple RGB and black theme fits my room and desk set up. Generally matte black is very easy to pair with almost any setup so it has good flexibility for if I’d want to change anything outside of the PC. August 28, 2023

1. What do you think worked well with the presentation?
<br>
2. If you had more time, would you have done something different?
<br>
3. What is your favorite and least favorite part of this assignment?
<br>
<br>		
I think that the information was good in the presentation but if given more time I'd want to improve the visuals and add even more information. My favorite part was putting transitions on the slides and my least favorite part was researching the information for my part of the presentation.

What is toxicity in gaming? Why is it important to understand? How can we combat toxicity?
https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/faculty-voice-gaming-and-toxicity 
Toxicity in gaming is primarily verbal abuse and it is important to understand as it affects others mental health as well as the enjoyment of the abuser themselves. We can combat toxicity by refraining from participating in chat, muting others, being a positive influence, and according to the article you can simply tell others to not be “toxic”.

Look up a professional team for your favorite esports game.
What makes them a good team? What do they do well? What do they need to work on to get better?
<br>
<br>		
https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-paper-rex-redemption-of-most-beloved-valorant-champions-team/ 
<br>
<br>		
	PRX (Paper Rex) a Singaporean based team for valorant has excellent teamwork and have some amazing individual playmakers as well. The players get along very well outside of the game and one of the things that holds them together is their experienced coach Alecks. One of their greatest qualities but also one of their somewhat negatives is that they play unconvential compositions. Although it helps them gain an advantage and throw off the enemy team they have times where they could've won by playing conventially or would lose due them "throwing".

What makes a game good? Write Coaching/Mechanics a genre and the games within. What are the best games in that genre? What are the worst? What makes them good/bad games?
<br>
<br>		
	In a good competitive fighting game the most important factor is character balance. Although you need to have different effects and characters that have unique designs or abilities you cannot have characters too overpowered. Inherently all fighter games have characters that are obviously better or stronger than other characters they are still able to be countered. Some of the best games in this genre are Street Fighter, Tekken, Super Smash Bros, and Mortal Kombat.

I would rather be playing Terraria and Plato
<br>
<br>
My favorite game of all time is Terraria
<br>
<br>
Terraria is an excellent sandbox game as it has a lot of content and an active modding community. Not only does it have a lot of content in terms of bosses, items, npcs, and world but community filled with memes content creators. 
<br>
<br>
Plato is a good mobile game to play as it is like an arcade with different popular minigames such as cup pong, pool, monopoly equivalent, bounce, and more. It is popular with android users as they cannot use game pigeon and has most of the same games but with online matchmaking compatibility.
<br>
<br>
The reviews for Terraria is mostly entirely positive which I completely agree with as it is a simple yet fun game with varying difficulty. It accomodates towards beginners or people who prefer different roles/content in games.
<br>
<br>
The reviews for Plato are mostly positive as well since it fulfills the role of what game pidgeon would be in equivalence for android. It also is a free app which doesn't force you to watch ads in order for it to make profit.

It was easy to set up the recording and audio 
<br>
<br>
Editing the clips
<br>
<br>
No, it can give better visual effects 
<br>
<br>
Editing the video to have commentary afterward
<br>
<br>
The setup is easy, the work after recording is difficult
<br>
<br>
It makes it easier to know what to say during the recording or clarity when speaking after the clip

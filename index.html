        <h2 style="text-align: center;">- Overview -</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Valorant, originally known as “Project A” is a competitive strategy based first person shooter. With the wide selection of agents with unique abilities, slower paced movement, and gunplay you must rely on your skills as well as your teammates to win. The format has a similar economic system as CS:GO in which you are rewarded by round wins, plants, and kills but the difference is that it is 13 won rounds to win. The teams are split into defenders and attackers side in which they are swapped after the 12th round. The goal of each round is for attackers to plant the bomb and have it explode or eliminate the entire enemy team. While the objective of the defenders is to prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb if it is planted, or eliminate the entire enemy team before the bomb is planted.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">- Audience -</h3>
        <p>.    This guide is targeted towards more beginner level / lower ranked players, this will be useful as i’ll be talking about the basic mechanics of the game as in gunplay, movement, map/team awareness, and a few other game related tips. Improving any of these areas enough will enhance your gameplay significantly. Valorant is rated PEGI 16"</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">- Mechanics -</h2>
        <p>To play the game successfully you must be able to frag (eliminate an enemy), be well positioned, and have impactful utility. To get better at the game, work on the things previously mentioned.

Methods on improving fragging is to work on aim and movement. Aim and movement will be the most important skill to work on when trying to improve early on or in lower ranks. Participating in deathmatches, playing the default game modes, and watching pro players can help improve your movement. For an aim you want to refrain from flicking, learn to incorporate your movement into your aim, try programs like aimlabs to help improve your raw aim, but most importantly work on your crosshair placement (which you can work in deathmatches as well). After improving fragging you want to have a solid understanding of your utility as it can give you the advantage in a fight or even single handedly score you a frag.
Valorant can be a difficult game to pick up as there are many things you have to learn and account for just to get started. Even after you are accustomed to the sound cues and gunplay, the ever evolving meta and new agents make it impossible to sit still. </p>

What makes video games so enticing and entertaining?

Video games have many graphics and different sorts of stories that can entertain many different interest groups. With the many possibilities it allows people to consistently be surprised or experience new things which can give a sense of achievement. That sense of achievement can be accomplished as well by the game creating goals or milestones that often give a dopamine boost from completion.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/why-people-love-games.html 

	According to the article video games have such interest due to the choices and actions we control in an environment that only simulates consequence rather than having actual risk. As well as having a sense of importance made from the fake consequence, video games abuse the system of competition which as seen through all of history is an extremely powerful driving force and motivator. The utility of competition is almost endless, as others develop their skills they will be matched with a challenge and the consistent challenge allows games to hold people's interest for extended periods of time.

Look up your favorite game for a review, do you agree or disagree, write a paragraph

https://www.corrosionhour.com/valorant-review/

	I mostly agree with the article written by Digital Ghost especially on the mechanical aspects mentioned. The sound design is well done as the ability to use sound cues for positioning and covering other actions adds a need for situational awareness. The economy system is also an extremely important system that players need to be aware of as it can give advantage and disadvantage each round but ultimately you can still win regardless of economy with enough skill. Though the one point I do not fully agree with is the quality of the storyline as, yes it is seen throughout the map, and yes it is well developed but it is very separate from the actual game and is simply only an addition. Most people are unaware of the actual story and it is not advertised well as a part of the game rather something that some people happen to find.

Then find your dream rig online. It could be a prebuilt or it could be a custom made machine. It could be a desktop or a laptop. You decide what you want to prioritize. Explain why this would be a good computer for you.

	I already own almost my dream PC but I'd also settle for this PC as it has all the specs to run any games I'd want to play. With a terabyte of space as well as 32 gb of ram storage and running multiple things at the same time will not be a problem whatsoever. As well as high performance GPU and CPU I will be able to run whatever specific game I'd like such as heavier triple A games and if I'm able to run heavy games I'd also be able to do regular tasks such as schoolwork and streaming videos perfectly fine. On top of its general strength it has a good aesthetic appeal seeing as how the purple RGB and black theme fits my room and desk set up. Generally matte black is very easy to pair with almost any setup so it has good flexibility for if I’d want to change anything outside of the PC. August 28, 2023
1. What do you think worked well with the presentation?
2. If you had more time, would you have done something different?
3. What is your favorite and least favorite part of this assignment?
	I think that the information was good in the presentation but if given more time I'd want to improve the visuals and add even more information. My favorite part was putting transitions on the slides and my least favorite part was researching the information for my part of the presentation.

What is toxicity in gaming? Why is it important to understand? How can we combat toxicity?
https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/faculty-voice-gaming-and-toxicity 
Toxicity in gaming is primarily verbal abuse and it is important to understand as it affects others mental health as well as the enjoyment of the abuser themselves. We can combat toxicity by refraining from participating in chat, muting others, being a positive influence, and according to the article you can simply tell others to not be “toxic”.

Look up a professional team for your favorite esports game.
What makes them a good team? What do they do well? What do they need to work on to get better?

https://thesportsrush.com/gaming-news-paper-rex-redemption-of-most-beloved-valorant-champions-team/ 

	PRX (Paper Rex) a Singaporean based team for valorant has excellent teamwork and have some amazing individual playmakers as well. The players get along very well outside of the game and one of the things that holds them together is their experienced coach Alecks. One of their greatest qualities but also one of their somewhat negatives is that they play unconvential compositions. Although it helps them gain an advantage and throw off the enemy team they have times where they could've won by playing conventially or would lose due them "throwing".

What makes a game good? Write about a genre and the games within. What are the best games in that genre? What are the worst? What makes them good/bad games?
	In a good competitive fighting game the most important factor is character balance. Although you need to have different effects and characters that have unique designs or abilities you cannot have characters too overpowered. Inherently all fighter games have characters that are obviously better or stronger than other characters they are still able to be countered. Some of the best games in this genre are Street Fighter, Tekken, Super Smash Bros, and Mortal Kombat.
